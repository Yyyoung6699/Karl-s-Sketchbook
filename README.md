# Karl-s-Sketchbook
## Project overview
A 3D puzzle narrative game, Karl's Sketchbook uses fragmented narrative combined with image recognition technology to allow players to follow Karl's footsteps and explore the creation process and life experience of each piece of artwork.

Using Karl's sketchbook as a starting point, branch out to tackle seven different puzzles with eight of Karl's drawings with notes to solve them. Each drawing, the notes, and the puzzles contain parts of fragmented story content or clues.

Players will need to explore and decipher Karl's paintings and select matching painting to interact with the puzzles to pass the puzzle. This process involves players not only appreciating the aesthetics of Karl's artwork, but also understanding it as an integral part of the puzzle, and appreciating the meaning behind each of Karl's works.
