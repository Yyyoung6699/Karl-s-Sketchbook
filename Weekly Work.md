# Weekly work
## Week 1 Project proposal
### Inspiration
Inspired by a new puzzle game called Viewfinder, it transforms 2D photos into part of a 3D game scene through the in-game camera, a clever perspective-based puzzle mechanic. I found this mechanic very interesting, so I decided to try to make a 3D puzzle game using this mechanic. While puzzle games are usually accompanied by a story narrative, after referring to some puzzle narrative games, I decided to try a fragmented narrative to tell a story. Image recognition technology has been used with success in previous projects, so I was curious about what the effect of introducing new image recognition technology into a puzzle game would be. As a result, a 3D puzzle narrative game incorporating image recognition technology was born.
