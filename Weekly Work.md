# Weekly work
## Week 1 Project proposal
### Inspiration
Inspired by a new puzzle game called Viewfinder, it transforms 2D photos into part of a 3D game scene through the in-game camera, a clever perspective-based puzzle mechanic. I found this mechanic very interesting, so I decided to try to make a 3D puzzle game using this mechanic. Puzzle games are usually accompanied by a story narrative, after referring to some puzzle narrative games, I decided to try a fragmented narrative to tell a story. Image recognition technology has been used with success in previous projects, so I was curious about what the effect of introducing new image recognition technology into a puzzle game would be. As a result, a 3D puzzle narrative game incorporating image recognition technology was born.

### Other working in this area
#### Viewfinder
Viewfinder is an experiment started around November 2019 by indie game developer Matt Stark. This game was my inspiration, and I experienced that instant sense of surprise from the incredible puzzle mechanics in this game. This game was my inspiration, and I experienced that instant sense of surprise from the incredible puzzle mechanics in this game, an emotional value that I think is a key factor in puzzle games engaging players.

#### What Remains of Edith Finch
What Remains of Edith Finch, developed by Giant Sparrow, The game is presented as an interconnected anthology, and, utilising unique mediums from varying The game is presented as an interconnected anthology, and, utilising unique mediums from varying perspectives, the story is told through a series of vignettes. This storyline is constructed in a patchwork fashion, assembling itself through a sequence of unearthed manuscripts -a characteristic element often found in Gothic fiction. Each manuscript triggers an interactive micronarrative that portrays the demise of members from the Finch family (Ewan Kirkland, 2020).

#### Mencage
Moncage is a puzzle game created by Dong Zhou and Yijia Chen of New York University, which uses a large number of optical illusions, requiring the player to use their brain and imagination to find the connection between those ordinary scenes and objects, resulting in unexpected and wonderful interactions. interaction, splicing, and then witnessing the birth of a miracle. Like Viewfinder, they bring players an emotional value of surprise and amazement when they succeed in solving the puzzles.

### Research target
The aim of this project is to investigate narrative and puzzle design in puzzle games by designing and producing a puzzle narrative game.

Explore the use of fragmented narratives in a puzzle narrative game. Explore how referencing image recognition technology has an impact on puzzle games and fragmented narratives. In addition, to explore what kind of puzzle design can bring unexpected emotional value to the player in the context of other successful puzzle games (WOW! MOMENT).

The research plan will be both theoretical and practical, and eventually invite players to play and record their social process to evaluate the project.  These research results will provide useful theoretical and practical guidance for game production and promote the development and innovation of the game industry.
